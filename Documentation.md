## Circuit Design 
May 19th 2025

* Created beginning of circuit design for for ADC623 INA126 testing circuit 
![Circuit Brainstorming](Documentation/brainstorming.jpeg)
* Started with Kicad circuit creation

May 20th 2025

*Built and Tested Voltage Regulator Circuit (working)
*Built and Tested Sine Wave Generator Circuit (working)
    *Decided against using 555 timer for sine wave oscillating signal 
    *Both circuits were built on an open breadboard to start with to allow us to troubleshoot easily 
    *Decided on Potentionmeter Min Resistance as 10kOhm
