## Circuit Design 
May 19th 2025

* Created beginning of circuit design for for ADC623 INA126 testing circuit 
![Circuit Brainstorming](Documentation/brainstorming.jpeg)
* Started with Kicad circuit creation

May 20th 2025

* Built and Tested Voltage Regulator Circuit (working)
* Built and Tested Sine Wave Generator Circuit (working)
    * Decided against using 555 timer for sine wave oscillating signal 
    * Both circuits were built on an open breadboard to start with to allow us to troubleshoot easily 
    * Decided on Potentionmeter Min Resistance as 10kOhm
